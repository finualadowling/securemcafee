What You Need Before You Start
------------------------------

To begin your download and activation, make sure you have:

- Your 25-digit McAfee product key (usually found on the card or inside the product box)

Once you gather these, you’re ready to move forward with the process to **Download McAfee After Purchased**.

Step 1: Go to the McAfee Activation Page
----------------------------------------

Start by visiting the official activation site provided by McAfee for retail products:

`https://www.mcafee.com/activate`_

This is the only official site for retail product activation. Avoid downloading McAfee software from third-party or unofficial websites, as these may contain outdated or unsafe versions.

On the activation page:

1. Enter the 25-digit activation key exactly as it appears on your retail card.

If you already have a McAfee account, simply sign in using your email and password. If this is your first McAfee product, you’ll need to create an account.
